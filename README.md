* ##Test the application:

It is not possible to register new users via the application at the moment. If you don't do it manually via the function "insertUserToDatabase".
However I already registered two users already to test:

* User 1

    * Username: Admin 
    * Password: Password
* User 2
    * Username: user1 
    * Password: password1
